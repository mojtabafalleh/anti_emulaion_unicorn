# 🛡️ Anti Emulation: Unicorn Engine Detection

This project demonstrates a technique to detect if a program is running under an emulator — specifically [Unicorn Engine](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn). It can be used as part of anti-debugging, DRM protection, or anti-reverse-engineering strategies to prevent emulation-based analysis of protected code.
